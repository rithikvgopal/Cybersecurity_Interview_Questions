How do you configure rules within a SIEM to identify potential security incidents? Please provide an example.

Situation: In my previous role as a cybersecurity analyst at XYZ company, we faced an increasing number of security incidents due to sophisticated phishing attacks. 
These attacks were bypassing our initial defenses and reaching users, leading to compromised credentials and potential data breaches.

Task: My task was to enhance our SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system's capability to detect these phishing attempts early and to respond swiftly. 
This required creating specific rules within the SIEM to identify patterns and anomalies associated with phishing attacks.

Action: To configure rules within the SIEM, I undertook the following steps:
Identified Key Indicators:
• Analyzed previous phishing incidents to identify common indicators such as multiple failed login attempts, unusual login times, and logins from unfamiliar IP addresses.
Defined the Rule Logic:
• Created a rule to trigger an alert when there are more than five failed login attempts within a 10-minute window from the same IP address.
• Configured another rule to detect logins from IP addresses not previously associated with the user, especially if these logins occurred outside of normal working hours.
Implemented the Rules:
• Used the SIEM’s interface to input these rules. For example, in Splunk, I created a correlation search using SPL (Search Processing Language):

sql
Copy code
index=authentication sourcetype=auth_logs | stats count by src_ip user | where count > 5 | table _time src_ip user 
• For unusual login times and locations, I set up a dashboard to visualize these anomalies and created alerts for immediate action.
Tested and Tuned:
• Conducted several tests by simulating phishing attempts to ensure the rules were effective without generating too many false positives.
• Fine-tuned the thresholds and conditions based on the test results and feedback from the incident response team.

Result: By implementing these rules, we significantly improved our ability to detect and respond to phishing attacks. Within the first month, 
we identified and mitigated three potential phishing incidents before they could cause significant harm. The early detection allowed our IT team to promptly reset compromised credentials and educate the affected users, thereby reducing the overall risk to the organization.
