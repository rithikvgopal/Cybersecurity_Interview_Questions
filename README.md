### [1. How do you configure rules within a SIEM to identify potential security incidents? Please provide an example.](#Answer_1)

### Answer_1

Situation - In my previous role as a cyber security analyst at the XYZ company, we observed an increase in the number of security incidents caused by sophisticated phishing attacks.
These attacks were able to bypass the initial defense in place.

Task - My task was to create SIEM rules that would detect these sophisticated attacks at an early stage and provide data to the incident response team to act swiftly. 

Action - So the first thing I did was to analyze the previous phishing events and identify key indicators - pattern or signature among them, like multiple failed logins, Login from IP not registered under the user, or change in IP location, etc. 
Once I had enough data, I created rules such as triggering an alert when there are 5 login attempts within a 10-minute window with the same IP address and another one when the IP location of the user is not the same as that of previous login events. 
Once these rules were created, I performed tests to ensure the effectiveness of the rules. I finetund it based on the results received as well as the feedback from the incident response team. 

Result - In the initial month, the initial response team was able to identify 3 phishing attacks swiftly change the credentials for the compromised account and provide education to the affected users.
